# Hinglish-Translator

This repository contains a python script which demonstrates a simple Hinglish(a mix of Hindi and English) translator. The script uses the spaCy library to identify nouns in English sentences. Then it uses the Google Translate API to perform the translation from English to Hindi. Finally, it replaces the translated nouns with the original English nouns.

# Required Libraries

spacy: For natural language processing. 
googletrans: For accessing the Google Translate API. 
pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
