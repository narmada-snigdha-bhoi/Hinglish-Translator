# Hinglish-Translator

This repository contains a python script which demonstrates a simple Hinglish(a mix of Hindi and English) translator. The script uses the spaCy library to identify nouns in English sentences. Then it uses the Google Translate API to perform the translation from English to Hindi. Finally, it replaces the translated nouns with the original English nouns.
